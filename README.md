# Quiz on Batman

## Tech stack:

A CLI app made with Javascript using Replit IDE.

## About:

The project was made as a part of Level Zero of [neogcamp](https://neog.camp/).

The quiz consists of 8 question with 4 options for each. You just have to type the number that is beside the option you want to give.

Note: 
* You don't need to use the "Enter" key.
* Input other than keys 1 to 4 is invalid and won't result in anything.

I have also added functionality such that if user breaks a high score updated high scores are shown. Used 'chalk' package for better visuals.
